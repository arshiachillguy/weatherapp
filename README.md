# Weather App

This project is a simple backend-focused application built with Java and the Spring Boot framework. It displays weather information for different cities through browser searches. It uses the public OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data (such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed). The project does not include a frontend; it is purely a simple API, making it suitable for learning Java, Spring Boot, and web APIs.

## Features
- Displays current temperature, weather conditions, and humidity via browser search
- Uses a free weather API

## Technologies
- **Java**: For implementing backend logic
- **Spring Boot**: For building and managing the API
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For weather data

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-link>`
2. Get a free API Key from OpenWeatherMap.
3. Add the API Key to the project configuration file (e.g., `application.properties`).
4. View the data in your browser by entering a URL like: `http://localhost:8080/weather?city=Tehran`
